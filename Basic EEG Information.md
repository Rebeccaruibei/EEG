# Basic EEG information
- Measure Brain Activity using electrodes paced on the scalp.
- This is done by measuring the activity of large groups of neurons being triggered by a specific event (can't measure a single neuron).
- Measures the postsynaptic potential of the neurons - the potential once the neurotransmitter binds to the recptors on the postsynaptic neurone, triggering an electrical impulse. The EEG can only easily penetrate into the Cerebral Cortex.
- Used to diagnose epilepsy and other brain disorders.
