Measure Brain Activity using electrodes paced on the scalp.
This is done by measuring the activity of large groups of neurons being triggered by a specific event (can't measure a single neuron).
Measures the postsynaptic potential of the neurons - the potential once the neurotransmitter binds to the recptors on the postsynaptic neurone, triggering an electrical impulse. The EEG can only easily penetrate into the Cerebral Cortex.
Used to diagnose epilepsy and other brain disorders.
